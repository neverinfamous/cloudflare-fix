## Intermittent JSON Parsing Errors in MCP Server

### Issue Description

The Cloudflare MCP server experiences intermittent JSON parsing errors and race conditions, particularly during high-load operations, server shutdowns, and cross-server interactions. The most common error appears as:

```
Unexpected token 'S', "Successful"... is not valid JSON
```

### Reproduction Conditions

This issue occurs most frequently under the following conditions:
- High CPU load
- Application startup
- Saving settings in profile panels
- Server shutdown sequences
- Cross-server interactions

### Root Cause Analysis

After thorough investigation, we've identified several contributing factors:

1. **Raw String Messages**: During certain operations (especially in `transportSuccess()`), raw strings like "Successful" are sent directly to stderr without proper JSON-RPC formatting
2. **Race Conditions**: Cleanup processes during shutdown have race conditions in connection state management
3. **Inconsistent Error Reporting**: Error handling during cleanup uses inconsistent message formats
4. **Missing Sync Points**: The lack of synchronization points during critical operations leads to interleaved messages

### Attempted Solutions

We've implemented a partial fix (available at: https://github.com/neverinfamous/cloudflare-fix) that:

1. Standardizes transport messages using JSON-RPC 2.0 format
2. Adds sync points for critical operations
3. Implements state flags and timeouts to prevent race conditions

While our solution **reduced the frequency** of these errors, it did not completely resolve the issue. The errors still occur during high CPU load conditions.

### Recommended Comprehensive Solution

For a more robust fix, we recommend:

1. **Message Queue System**: Implementing a proper queue that maintains state during transitions
2. **Enhanced State Management**: Adding robust state tracking to prevent race conditions
3. **Graceful Shutdown Improvements**: Refining shutdown sequences for proper operation completion
4. **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardizing error reporting across all components

### Impact Assessment

For most users, this issue represents a minor inconvenience rather than a critical problem. The error typically requires restarting the desktop application but doesn't cause data loss or other serious issues.
